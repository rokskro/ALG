## Masters Project 
A educative web application using c# and .NET framework, aiming to teach secondary school childrem, elderly and untrained professionals about data security using encryption and decryption. Teaches the basics of algorithims, starting from simplistic ciphers and teaching about common encryption methods and their types: symmetrical & asymmetrical. Provides working examples of algorithims alongside curated notes and custom diagrams.

## Data Project
Database handling for seeding and creating algorithim information such as histiry, statisitcs and custom diagrams using Linq querying and SQLite
## Test Project
Testing ground for the implementation of adding, removing and checking clone instances of prexisiting database entries
## Web Project
-- WIP --
Implemenatations thus far:
- Guide tab (info about algorithims and encryption as a whole)
- Selecting algorithim from a database
- Shell pages created for algorithim details
- Caesar Cipher & A1Z26 cipher implemented
